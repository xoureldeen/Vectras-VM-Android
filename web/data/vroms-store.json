The first version was released in 1987. A feud between the two companies beginning in 1990 led to Microsoft’s leaving development solely to IBM, which continued development on its own. OS/2 Warp 4 in 1996 was the last major upgrade, after which IBM slowly halted the product as it failed to compete against Microsoft's Windows; updated versions of OS/2 were released by IBM until 2001."

It superseded Mac OS X Puma and preceded Mac OS X Panther. The operating system was initially available on 23 August 2002 either for single-computer installations, and in a \"family pack\", which allowed five installations on separate computers in one household. Most builds of Jaguar were compiled for PPC (for public use) and x86 (for testing purposes for the upcoming partnership with Intel, which would continue until the announcement in 2005). It is the last version of Mac OS to ship with Internet Explorer as the default browser, as it was replaced with Safari as of Mac OS X Panther, though it was still available as an optional component until Mac OS X Tiger."
